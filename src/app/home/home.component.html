    <hr/>

    <div class="justify-content-justify">
        <p>Motor insurance is a vehicle insurance policy that is mandatory for vehicles like trucks, cars, jeeps, bikes, scooters, etc. This policy offers coverage to the vehicle owner/driver against financial losses that may occur due to accidents or other kinds of damages.</p>
        <p>Having valid motor insurance is compulsory in India to protect vehicle owners from potential financial risks. It is the best form of security that you can acquire to prevent significant expenses that result after an accident. The Government poses the compulsion for the safety of the individuals who travel via motor vehicles daily.</p>
        <p>No one can deny that buying a vehicle is the second most expensive investment in a personâ€™s life after home. Thus, protecting the investment against unforeseen events is crucial. Considering the hike in the vehicle repair charges and the risks involved in driving, an unfortunate accident can put a big hole in your pocket.</p>
        <p>The yearly premiums that you pay for the motor insurance policy are meagre as compared to the advantages and protection the coverage will offer you in case of mishaps. Though there are many misconceptions regarding the policy, it will most certainly compensate you against the physical damage that arises under different circumstances.</p>

            </li>
